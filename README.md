Description
This Angular project serves as the front-end for a book trading platform. Users can register, log in, and manage their book listings. The app allows users to add books they no longer need, request to buy or trade books from other users, and approve or reject such requests. The application interacts with a REST API backend to handle user authentication, book management, and transaction workflows.

Technologies Used
Angular: Framework for building the front-end of the application.
TypeScript: Primary programming language.
HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface.
Reactive Forms: For handling form inputs and validations.
Angular Router: For navigation between different components.
HTTP Client: For making API requests to the backend.
This project demonstrates a comprehensive use of Angular features to build a dynamic and interactive book trading platform.
